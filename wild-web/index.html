        The science behind making machines talk just like humans is very complex, because our speech patterns are so nuanced.

        Birds make many different sounds. They chirp, whistle, trill, caw, rattle, drum, and much, much more. Vocally, they are in a class of their own. <br><br>But how do birds make these sounds?<br><br>

          "The voice is not easy to grasp," says Klaus Scherer, emeritus professor of the psychology of emotion at the University of Geneva. "To analyze the voice really requires quite a lot of knowledge about acoustics, vocal mechanisms and physiological aspects. So it is necessarily interdisciplinary, and quite demanding in terms of what you need to master in order to do anything of consequence."<br><br>

So it's not surprisingly taken well over 200 years for synthetic voices to get from the first speaking machine, invented by Wolfgang von Kempelen around 1800 – a boxlike contraption that used bellows, pipes and a rubber mouth and nose to simulate a few recognizably human utterances, like mama and papa – to a Samuel L. Jackson voice clone delivering the weather report on Alexa today. <br><br>

        Talking machines like Siri, Google Assistant and Alexa, or a bank's automated customer service line, are now sounding quite human. Thanks to advances in artificial intelligence, or AI, we've reached a point where it's sometimes difficult to distinguish synthetic voices from real ones.

        <br>Birds have the most complicated respiratory system amongst vertebrates. It is a more efficient system than in mammals. They have thin-walled air sacs that are connected to the lungs. These air sacs are not directly involved in gas exchange but act as a bellows that direct the flow of air through the lungs in one direction, from back to front. The genius of the air sacs is that they allow a continuous unidirectional flow of air during both inhalation and exhalation. Because of this specially equipped respiratory system, birds are able to sing at surprisingly high volumes, sometimes for minutes without interruption. <br><br>
